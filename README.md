# TriviaGame

Trivia Game is an app created for the Tandem Apprenticeship coding challenge. 

## For Tandem Reviewers of This Challenge:
I completed all the necessary requirements by the due date on November 1, 2020. Yet, I have since added a few more tests and abstractions for my own refinement and learning.

"Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select
from."

• We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a
JSON file

Acceptance Criteria

• Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
• Questions should not repeat in a round.
• A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
• The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
• A user can see the score they received at the end of the round
